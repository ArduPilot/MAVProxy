MAVProxy
========

**A UAV ground station software package for MAVLink based systems**

MAVProxy is a fully-functioning GCS for UAV's. The intent is for a
minimalist, portable and extendable GCS for any UAV supporting the
MAVLink protocol (such as one using ArduPilot).

MAVProxy was first developed by `CanberraUAV <http://www.canberrauav.org.au>`_,
to enable the use of companion computing and multiple datalinks with 
ArduPilot. It has grown to be one of the most versatile tools in the ArduPilot 
ecosystem, and many of the features users now see in other GCS tools 
can trace their origins to MAVProxy.

The team at CanberraUAV still lead development of MAVProxy: 
they are a volunteer organisation, but would appreciate your support.

Features
=========

-  It is a command-line, console based app. There are plugins included
   in MAVProxy to provide a basic GUI.
-  Can be networked and run over any number of computers.
-  It's portable; it should run on any POSIX OS with python, pyserial,
   and ``select()`` function calls, which means Linux, OS X, Windows, and
   others.
-  The light-weight design means it can run on small netbooks with ease.
-  It supports loadable modules, and has modules to support console/s,
   moving maps, joysticks, antenna trackers, etc
-  Tab-completion of commands.
