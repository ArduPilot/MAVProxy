MAVProxy
========

**A UAV ground station software package for MAVLink based systems**

MAVProxy is a fully-functioning GCS for UAV's. The intent is for a
minimalist, portable and extendable GCS for any UAV supporting the
MAVLink protocol (such as the APM).

Features
=========

-  It is a command-line, console based app. There are plugins included
   in MAVProxy to provide a basic GUI.
-  Can be networked and run over any number of computers.
-  It's portable; it should run on any POSIX OS with python, pyserial,
   and ``select()`` function calls, which means Linux, OS X, Windows, and
   others.
-  The light-weight design means it can run on small netbooks with ease.
-  It supports loadable modules, and has modules to support console/s,
   moving maps, joysticks, antenna trackers, etc
-  Tab-completion of commands.

A list of commits to MAVProxy (closest thing to a changelog that is
available) can be seen `here <https://github.com/ArduPilot/MAVProxy/commits/master>`_.
