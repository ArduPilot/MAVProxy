Air Traffic Controller (ATC)
============================

ATC is a MAVProxy module that introduces logic-programming capabilities to systems built from components that communicate with the MavLink protocol. It's a framework for generating rules-based software agents (e.g. mission-control programs) or other system components that employ this classic AI approach.

Current version: 0.1
--------------------
A work in progress, not at all finished. Little more than a twinkle in my eye at this stage.

Attempting to create a basic pre-flight check (permission to launch) using forward-chaining induction and a knowledge base of rules and questions.

Development Roadmap
-------------------

Todo:

 v0.1) "Hello World" type demonstration (forward-chaining).
 v0.2) Trivial agent which can be loaded/unloaded in it's own thread (generated by backward-chaining).
 v0.3) Something actually usefull.
 v0.4+) More usefull things...
 v1.0) Framework refactor, improve manageability of the growing collection of usefull things.
 v3.0) personal iron man suit.

Colaboration welcome, I'm working out of Github, https://github.com/monkeypants/MAVProxy

Overview / Design
-----------------

A MAVProxy module that hacks together a hardcoded knowledge base with the python knowledge engine (pyke).

After hello world, start figuring out some more details.
