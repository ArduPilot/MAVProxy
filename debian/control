Description: A MAVLink protocol proxy and ground station. MAVProxy
 is oriented towards command line operation, and is suitable for embedding in
 small autonomous vehicles or for using on ground control stations. It also
 features a number of graphical tools such as a slipmap for satellite mapping
 view of the vehicles location, and status console and several useful vehicle
 control modules. MAVProxy is extensible via a modules system - see the modules
 subdirectory for some example modules. MAVProxy was developed by CanberraUAV
 for use in the 2012 Outback Challenge, and includes a module for the
 CanberraUAV search and rescue system.
