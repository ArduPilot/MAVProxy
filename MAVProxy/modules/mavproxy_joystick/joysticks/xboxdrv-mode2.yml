  # A hat operates like a toggle switch.  When an axis goes positive,
  # it sets the `high` value, and when an axis goes negative it sets the
  # `low` value.  When the hat is centered it does not change the
  # current channel value. This configuration maps the hat X axis to
  # channel 7 and the Y axis to channel 8; these are useful along with
  # the CH7_OPT and CH8_OPT APM parameters.

  # Buttons act as momentary switches.  When pressed they set the
  # corresponding pwm to their `high` value, when released the pwm is
  # set to the `low` value.  `low` defaults to 1000, `high` defaults
  # to 2000.
