"""
Currently what I do is run a sync every second and keep the following:
time_send
time_receive

As a result the delta between GCS time and drone time is:
dtime = (time_send + time_receive) / 2 - drone_time;

And when doing that a lot the dtime will average to the correct
delta. As a result it is now possible to know exactly when a
"GLOBAL_POSITION_INT" was created in GCS time.
