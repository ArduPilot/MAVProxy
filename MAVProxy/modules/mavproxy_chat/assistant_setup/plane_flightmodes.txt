This file holds the Plane flight mode name to number mapping.  Modes starting with Q are only for use with QuadPlanes.

MANUAL = 0, // pilot has direct control over servos without stabilization
CIRCLE = 1, // Circle around a GPS waypoint
STABILIZE = 2, // Level flight stabilization
TRAINING = 3, // Limits the roll and pitch angles to keep the aircraft stable
ACRO = 4, // Full manual aerobatic control with some stabilization
FLY_BY_WIRE_A = 5, // Stabilized flight with manual throttle
FLY_BY_WIRE_B = 6, // More stabilization than FLY_BY_WIRE_A
CRUISE = 7, // Mixed manual and automatic throttle control
AUTOTUNE = 8, // Automatically tune the PID controller for optimal performance
AUTO = 10, // Fully autonomous flight, following a pre-programmed mission
RTL = 11, // Return to Launch point
LOITER = 12, // Circle around a point while maintaining altitude
TAKEOFF = 13, // Automated takeoff sequence
AVOID_ADSB = 14, // Avoidance maneuver triggered by ADS-B aircraft detection
GUIDED = 15, // Remotely guided commands from GCS or companion computer
INITIALISING = 16, // Initialization mode at startup
QSTABILIZE = 17, // QuadPlane's stabilize mode.  Similar to Copter's stabilize mode
QHOVER = 18, // QuadPlane's hover mode.  Similar to Copter's AltHold mode
QLOITER = 19, // QuadPlane's loiter mode.  Similar to Copter's Loiter mode
QLAND = 20, // QuadPlane's land mode.  Similar to Copter's Land mode
QRTL = 21, // QuadPlane's Return to Launch mode.  Similar to Copter's RTL mode
QAUTOTUNE = 22, // QuadPlane's autotune mode.  Similar to Copter's AutoTune mode
QACRO = 23, // QuadPlane's acrobatic mode.  Similar to Copter's Acro mode
THERMAL = 24, // Thermal detection and exploitation mode
LOITER_ALT_QLAND = 25, // QuadPlane's loiter to alt then land mode
